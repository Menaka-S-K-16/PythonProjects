Discipline turns a talented person into the exceptional one. The only way to achieve success is constant self-improvement. Having a person in a team who truly values discipline is the only way to achieve great results. There are no missed deadlines or opportunities, weak work standards and wrong estimations because they simply do not exist in the life of a truly disciplined individual. I am not scared of being put out of my comfort zone, I enjoy tight deadlines because I see challenge in them. I am looking for more responsibilities because I can not wait to make an impact.

Started simple, with some LOGO and BASIC when I was in Grade 6, at 12 years old, as part of mandatory class work. I learned a little more in high school, took Comp Sci 11 when I was in Grade 10, and finished Comp Sci 12 in Grade 12 learning Turbo Pascal. Developed my first game as a class project, and presented it to the school Principal. And that is where I stopped. Big mistake. 
I've done ""jobs"". Not programming jobs...just regular jobs. Jobs I pretty much always hated and got bored of quickly. McDonalds. Tim Horton's. Temporary labour jobs. Office jobs. Call center jobs. But nothing ever stuck until recently, I actually held down a job for 2 years. Maybe I grew up? But as expected...eventually, i got bored, as well as sick, because it wasn't the healthiest environment. For the first time...I felt satisfaction, I enjoyed what I did, enjoyed the corporation, the people I worked with. But i still struggled to maintain my interest after the 1st year, and it showed. My attendance slipped. I still worked hard...when I was there! </p>

<p>But eventually, they were forced to let me go. No hard feelings. I understood. I went into a depression. Spent much of my time gaming... and it hit me. At 40 years old, I'm still interested in gaming? And technology? Why don't I DO something about it? I applied for EI (still waiting), and decided...in the meantime... why don't I spend the time that I was gaming... learning? So... here I am. A beginner, since all that language knowledge of over 20 years ago is obsolete. I hope however, some of the lessons about the FUNDAMENTALS of programming stuck, even if the languages themselves won't benefit me at this stage.</p>

1982 | Computer 2: Dragon 32 built in speech synthesizer!)<br>
1983 | Computer 3: Commodore VIC64</p>

<p>Later: c128 - Amiga… And then 1986. Macintosh Plus (even if the Amiga was cooler for a couple of years ahead). </p>

<p>The difference now from back in the days, was that to do something you learned about how things worked. Of course we where dreaming of the future (a pixel digitzied photo on C64 by Triad if i remember it correctly, was amazing back then!), where things was easy. No CLI, and no tuning the cassette player to load data correctly (if you played music on your stereo, some data would fail to load). </p>

<p>But now, the CLI is fun again. I got no Unix Beard, and my line of work is not coding (Graphic Artist). However, i want to learn things. Instead of buying a expensive license of some poorly done GUI app to do certain things, i mostly ending up doing myself with ”remixing” Open Source Code and doing BASH scripts or using Automator (with Shell Scripts).</p>

<p>Also i'm extremly greatful for all the people using Open Source Licenses for others to study, learn and use. I hate when Large (and small) corporations using Open Source Code and don't respect the Licenses, which seems to be more common. </p>

<p>So, that's the Unix Beard part. The rest of the story you can read in my memoirs (kidding!). Cheers!</p>

I like playing around with Illustrator and Photoshop and I usually design in the browser, sometimes is not worth to pay twice (designer + developer) when the developer has basic design skills - designing in the browser gives me the power to prototype the app keeping in mind user experience and user interface, than moving to design concepts and elements phase.

I taught myself BASIC / QuickBASIC / QBASIC in elementary school, took courses in Pascal in high school. and took a couple basic C++ classes when I first moved to Austin. I worked at several companies as a Technical Support Representative.</p>
<p>After receiving a BS in Chemistry from Texas State University, I decided I wanted to develop software and thus started a career change. I started teaching myself Python, while at the same time I was being mentored by a good friend of mine. I gained much on-the-job experience as a Production Engineer at Zilliant, especially with Microsoft SQL Server, Python, and Tableau, among other software like JIRA and Confluence. Eventually, I decided I needed formal programming classes and so I started going back to ACC for an Associate Degree in CIT: Computer Programming and a Certificate in Java Programming specialization. I just finished my ACC program this last May 2020.</p>
<p>I am open to work opportunities in software support, database support, Linux/Windows administration, and junior or associate level software development,</p>
<p>I specialize in object-oriented programming with Java, C++, Python, Oracle PL/SQL, Linux bash scripting, some Assembly, and utilizing AWS services and APIs. I'm skilled in troubleshooting data issues in code, databases, and AWS configurations. I enjoy utilizing version control (git, GitHub, Perforce, BitBucket, AWS' CodeCommit), issue tracking (JIRA, Bugzilla), and updating internal documentation (Confluence).</p>
<p>Most recently, I taught myself JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Express, Flask, Java Spring / Spring Boot, and Docker. Next on my list will be creating my own API(s) microservice(s), diving deeper into unit testing, and also CI/CD. Maybe some Kubernetes, and then I've heard good things about GitLab for an all-in-one solution for CI/CD.</p>

<h2>HELLO STACK,</h2> 
<p>Name's C Brennan Poole.</p>
<p> I'm a first-time founder who managed to make the mistake of chasing growth / acknowledgement prior to having a sound infrastructure in place to handle it.</p>
<p>All that hardly matters with <strong>pandemic, epidemic, overdose crisis</strong> and this global state of <strong>uncertainty.</strong></p>
<p>
<h3>I AIM</h3>
I aim to conduct the <strong>[train to digital glory][4]</strong>. While helping to <strong>slay the beasts of ignorance.</strong></p>
<p>FIRST, let's get to <strong>drop-kicking a pandemic</strong> while <strong>ending an epidemic -how about it?</strong></p>
<p>
<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
I have over a dozen years experience in <strong>logistics</strong> - more specifically - the <strong>less-than-load (LTL) freight and transportation</strong> industry.</p>
</p>
<p>
<h3>RCB</h3>
I am a <em>proud Georgia State Panther</em>. Class of 2006. Graduating from the <em>South's oldest and most storied business college</em> - <strong>Robinson College of Business</strong>. RCB also has the most sitting in the C-Suite currently <i>(among all Southern Institutions)</i>. I also was a <strong>Faculty Scholar (2004)</strong> and made <strong>Dean's List</strong> 2005. 
</p>
<p>
I hold a <strong>Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)</strong> with a concentration in <strong>Service Operations Management.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<h3>THE WRECK</h3>
A car accident in 2012 sidelined me and effectively ended my personal fast-track to the C-Suite at the age of 29.
</p>
<p>
I would sped the next five years battling all sorts of enemies - especially the <em>self</em>.
</p>
<p>
<h3>PURPOSE FOR SERVICE</h3>
I found clarity back on my thirty-sixth birthday <strong>05TEN19</strong> and now hold a <strong>hyper-focus purpose for service</strong> (which commingles with <strong>IT</strong> and someday sooner-than-later <strong>DevOps</strong>; slash all things <strong>digital skilling, IT, and cloud computing</strong> - which I have been doing.
</p>
<p>
I am currently working on <strong>Google's IT Automation Certification and Crash Coursera™ on Python</strong>).
</p>
<p>
I have been on an <em>apprenticeship hunt</em> - seeking <strong>IT, Remote, apprenticeship</strong> for the better part of a year <i>(just missed the call by Stack around December 2019).</i>
</p>
<p>
I seek an <strong>actionable path to DevOps</strong>- with <em>just the semblance of fair pay</em> - should anyone out there know of any.
</p>
<p>
Best,
C Brennan P

The constant need to build high-quality applications forced me to jump into full-stack development. Equipping self with the present and future technologies have proven to be so empowering which I did not feel even after an MBA in Marketing and Entrepreneurship in 2014.

<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, I love writing codes. Ever since writing my first
program in C at age of 12 and manipulating it to produce a desired
output, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve
practical problems. And from C programming to moving on C++ then to
Java and finally to Python my journey has been soo life changing.
<em>Software engineering</em> is a never ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving, as there is always new challenges and new problems
with the time and solving those real life problems with help of coding
gives another level of satisfaction. I believe in the power of
programming to transform and improve the lives of people around me and
around the world.</p>

<p>I'm a self-taught programmer (dabbled a bit around 12, but didn't really get started until two years later) that just wants to get to know more about web development and computers in general. Despite this, I <em>hate</em> school (can't really learn there).</p>

<p>Currently I'm proficient in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, I'm learning Python and Rust, with a bit of C on the side so I can understand how to use pointers better.</p>

<p>Having said that, some of the languages considering to in the future are:</p>

<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Racket</li>
<li>Lua</li>
</ul>
